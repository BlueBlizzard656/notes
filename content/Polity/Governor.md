- Removal w/o notice
	- reduces sanctity of position
	- violates PNJ
	- compromises independence of office
	- over politicization of post

### BP Singhal v UoI
- pwr of UoI to remove Gov subject to JR if petitioner can prove that removal was based on arbitrary grounds
- mere variance of opinions not grounds for removal
- ==judgement criticized==
	- how can petitioner prove arbitrary grounds?

### Way ahead
- CoM must behave responsibly. Should not misuse power
	- not possible in reality $\leftarrow$ political compulsions
- $\therefore$ expert bodies suggested removal must happen as per a resolution passed by SLA or Parl

## Reforms?
- 1st and 2nd Centre State Relations Commission suggested that Gov should be from outside State so that he is not affected by State politics
- Eminent person from some walk of life to restore lost glory associated with position so that he may withstand undue pol pressure
- should not have active part in politics in recent times
- UCoM must actively consult SCoM before making an appt to such positions
