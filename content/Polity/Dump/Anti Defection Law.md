## Background
- 60s - 80s: defection became extremely prevalent
	- money and power benefits
- Parl enacted **52nd CAA 1985**, added **Article 102(2)**, **Schedule 10**
- objective
	- prevent defection culture
	- ensure stability of govt
	- reduce role of money power
	- prevent corrupt practices influencing voting in house
## Disqualification
- if chosen member voluntarily gives up membership of pol party $\implies$ liable for disqualification
- if person votes contrary to dirn issued by pol party and action not condemned by pol party in 15 days
- independent candidate joins a party
- nominated candidate joins party after 6mo
## Not disqualified if
- nominated member joins party within 6mo and not be disqualified
- "merger": if $\geq \frac{2}{3}$ members split and join \ form other party $\implies$ no defection
	- original clause: "split" $\geq \frac{1}{3}$
- Presiding officer may resign from pol party and may rejoin original party after his term $\rightarrow$ no defection

## Decision wrt disqualification under ADL
- **Para 6, ADL**: all decisions taken by Presiding Officer
- no time limit for decision by PO
- **Para 7, 10th Schedule**: barred court from exercising jurisdiction on matters of disqualification under ADL
- **Kihoto Holohan Case**: SC upheld constitutional validity of ADL
	- promotes clean politics and reduces role of money power
	- but struct down Para 7
		- JR part of [[Basic Structure Doctrine]]
	- held that speakers arts like tribunal (when ADL)
		- $\therefore$ courts cannot be excluded from jurisdiction
## Challenges
- compromises role of individual legislator
- lack of internal party democracy
- undermines principle of representative democracy
	- whip == party representative, not public representative
- law silent on time taken by PO to decide matters
	- advantageous to ruling party
- exception of merger allows wholesale treading
- weakened position of opposition as exec already has maj and ruling party legis can't question exec
- law doesn't apply to pol party and coalitions

## Way Ahead
- **2nd ARC**: PO should be relieved; powers vested with ECI or independent tribunal
- consider Brit practice: once a speaker, always a speaker
- follow principles laid down in court in **Kihoto Holohan Case**
	- ADL must apply only when stability of govt threatened
