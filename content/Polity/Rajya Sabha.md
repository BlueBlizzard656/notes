## National Commission to review the working of the Constitution (NCRWC) - Equal representation
- smaller states feel present system discriminatory against them
	- NE States total 14 seats
	- UP alone 31 seats

- rep on basis of population turns RS into ==replica of LS== while it was supposed to be away from populist politics of LS and act as chamber of discussion and deliberation

- may result in greater demand for smaller states leading to ever increasing RS size
- equal rep regardless of population may be discriminatory against larger states
