## Way ahead
 - extra attention to scrutiny at early stage (hence save time by not entertaining baseless PIL)
	 - dubious/ frivolous PIL be rejected by court with exemplary cost
 - court should restrain itself on entering domain of other organs on pretext of  PIL (sep of power)
- exec/legis should have grievance redressal mechanism (so judiciary burden less)
	- citizens trust judiciary more; exec/legis must strive to build better rapport and trust among citizens
- Judges shouldn't be over enthusiast in giving dirn to exec due to populist reasons
